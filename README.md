# RIPE
Implementation of a rule based prediction algorithm called RIPE (Rule Induction Partitioning Estimate). RIPE is a deterministic and interpretable algorithm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
 RIPE is developed in Python version 2.7.
- NumPy (post 1.13.0)
- Scikit-Learn (post 0.19.0)
- Pandas (post 0.16.0)
- SciPy (post 1.0.0) 
- Matplotlib (post 2.0.2) 
- Seaborn (post 0.8.1)

```
sudo pip install package_name
```
To install a specific version
```
sudo pip install package_name==version
```

### Installing

The latest version can be installed from the master branch using pip:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/VMargot/RIPE.git
```

Another option is to clone the repository and install using ```python setup.py install``` or ```python setup.py develop```.
